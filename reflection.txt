## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnCalc` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a
   dodecahedron?  (Note: `edgeLength` is a parameter of the formula and should be parsed as a
   variable.)
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edgeLength 2 ^ *`

   Answer: 7

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: 2

## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: Implementing the evaluateCsv method inside the CsvEvaluator class was the hardest part
   of the assignment. This is because it required us to call on multiple classes, use a helper method,
   and use methods (such as .print()) that we had not yet worked with before. We realized that we
   were not using our enhanced for loop correctly. This meant that when we set a cell value based on
   what we thought was the correct row and col and needed to access it later, we were getting the
   wrong value. When we fixed this issue, our test cases passed.
